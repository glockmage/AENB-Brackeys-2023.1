// How to use this class:
/*
 * Make a prefab called "UnWalkableTile" that contains at minimum a sprite renderer and this script.
 * Make a tilemap grid at (0,0,0) in your scene, and create a tilemap child inside it at (0.5,0.5,0) relative to the grid
 * Drag and drop one "UnWalkableTile" into the tilemap child and line it up with the grid.
 * Use the GameObject brush and the eye-dropper tool to select and paint as many tiles as you want into your scene.
